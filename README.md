# Created RESTful API for movies using flash- restful (something similar to IMDB).

# There are 2 levels of access:
○ admin = who can add, remove or edit movies.
○ users = who can just view the movies.

# Test Cases Included for all routes
○ auth =  python -m unittest /tests/test_auth.py
○ movie =  python -m unittest /tests/test_movie.py
○ genre = python -m unittest /tests/test_genre.py
